1、 Susan Cleveland is the young president of a candy company in the city of Chicago. Her father began the company in the 1960's.He died three years ago. Now, the company belongs to Susan. Susan, however, did not have any jobs before becoming head of the company. She just finished the college. The employees became even more concerned during Susan's first months on the job. Mr. Cleveland had been a _____ (1) _____leader. But Susan permitted many employees to make their own _____ (2) _____.One employee said, "Old Mr. Cleveland always told us what to do. He kept people on a short leash. But the company did well.” What does a “short leash" mean? A leash is a kind of rope. We use a leash to walk our pet dogs. The leash keeps the dog from _____ (3) _____away or getting into trouble. Keeping a person on a short leash means keeping him or her under close control.The person can't make many decisions for himself or herself. Ms. Cleveland does not keep her workers on a short leash. _____ (4) _____, she encourages them to get better ways to do business. For example, her secretary proposed an idea. She said the company should offer a sum of money as a prize to the best student in the high school near the factory. The winner could use the prize money to study at a university. Ms. Cleveland appreciated the idea. After the prize was announced, people who lived in the area of the factory began to buy_____ (5) ______of the company's candy. Local newspapers wrote about the competition. Business improved. Ms. Cleveland made her secretary the company's first Director of Public Relations. The former secretary was very pleased. Susan Cleveland是芝加哥一家糖果公司的年轻总裁。他的父亲于上世纪60年代开办了这家公司，三年前去世了。现在公司归Susan所有。 然而，Susan在成为这家公司的总裁之前没有任何工作。她刚刚大学毕业。在Susan工作的第一个月期间员工们感到很担心。Cleveland先生曾经是一个非常强势的领导，但是Susan允许很多员工自己做决定。一名员工说：“Cleveland先生总是会告诉我们做什么，他总是紧紧的控制着我们，但公司运行的很好。”那么，short leash是什么意思？leash是一种绳子。我们用皮带leash遛狗，可以防止狗跑丢或者惹麻烦。 Keeping a person on a short leash 是指将某人牢牢控制住。这个人自己不能做任何决定。Cleveland女士则不控制她的员工。相反，她鼓励员工们创造更好的做生意的方法。例如，她的秘书提出了一个想法。他说，公司应该拿出一笔钱奖励工厂附近高中的尖子生。获奖学生可以用奖金支付大学学费。Cleveland女士很赞赏这个想法。在宣布这项奖励之后，住在工厂附近的人开始更多的购买该公司的糖果了。当地报纸也对此进行了报道。公司的生意越来越好了。 Cleveland女士任命这位秘书为公司的第一公共关系主管。这位前任秘书很高兴。

11、 “Mom, can I have some money?” those are the words my mother used to hear all the time. In return, I heard, “why don’t you get a job? Not to make the happy, but so that you have your own money and gain a bit more responsibility.” So last year I got a job working about 25 hours a week. For $5 an hour, working as a salesman in a photo studio. After I got this job, I had to do football, homework and job _____ (1) _____ . It was really hard for me. I was burning out, falling asleep at school and failing in many courses. My teachers were mad _____ (2) _____ me and yelled at me: why have a job? I missed a lot practice in football team and could only _______ (3) _______back down at the match. My coach was cold at me with an unasked question: why have a job? I told them it was for the things I need, when actually it was or the things I wanted. Needing and wanting are different. Needing something is like your only shoes have holes in them. But wanting is to have every new brand sneaker just because you like it. I start to think about if I did a wrong thing. Slowly, I learnt to _____ (4) _____ my money better so that I could have more time for school and football. I learnt t make a wide decision _____ (5) _____ what I need and what I want. “妈妈，能给我一些钱吗？”这是我母亲过去经常听到的话，作为回应，我听到的是“你为什么不找个工作？虽然不快乐，但你可以有自己的钱，同时会获得一些尊重。”所以一年后，我找到工作。一周工作25个小时。5美元一小时， 在一家影楼做推销员。 我得到这份工作后，我不得不同时踢足球，做作业和做工作， 这对我来水真的很难。我太疲倦了，学习上耽误了，很多功课不及格，我的老师对我很生气，并责骂我为什么找工作？足球队上，我也缺少了很多训练， 比赛垫底。我的教练很生气，又不禁问到，你为什么要工作？ 我告诉他们， 这我是我想要一些事物时，我需要做的。需要和想要是不同的。需要的东西就像是你唯一的一双鞋子破了个洞。 想要就是你因为喜欢，就想要很多鞋子。我开始思考我是不是做错了。 最后我学会了更好地管理钱，以便我有足够的时间做好学习的事情和踢足球。我学会了在需要和想要之间的关系。

Then he jumped from a tall building. As you can imagine, he did not fly very far._____ (2) _____, he fell to the ground and broke several bones. The first real attempt at flying took place in France in 1783.The two Mongolian brothers knew that hot air rose. If they could fill a large balloon _____ (3) ______hot air, they thought it would rise into the air and fly. They were right. They made a very large hot air balloon of cloth and paper. It measured ten meters in diameter. They filled it with hot air and the balloon got two hundred meters into the air. It fell to earth about three kilometers away. At the next attempt, they _____ (4) _____ for a balloon to carry passengers. We do not know what the passengers felt about the trip as they were a cock, a duck, and a sheep. But we _____ (5) ______ know that the trip lasted eight minutes and the animals landed safely. 人类一直渴望飞翔。甚至在800年前有一位英国人，用鸡毛做了一堆翅膀，然后安在自己的背后从高楼上跳下。你可以想象，他并没有飞得多远，相反，他摔倒在地上，并断了几根骨头。在飞行史迈出真正意义上第一步的是1783年法国的蒙特戈夫兄弟，他们知道热气向上升，如果他们能把大气球填充热空气，气球就会升空，他们是对的，他们用布和纸做了一个非常大的热气球的，它测量直径十米，充满热空气的气球到了空中二百米。 下一次的尝试，他们安排了一些乘客乘坐热气球，我们不知道乘客此行的感受，因为这些乘客是一只鸡、一只鸭和一只羊。但是我们知道这次旅行持续了八分钟，动物安全降落。

A tree over a hundred years old means that it has more than a hundred_____ (3) _____.When the climate is dry or very cold, the trees do not grow very much and their rings are usually thin. When it is wet and warm, the rings are much thicker. If the rings are suddenly very thin or suddenly very thin or suddenly very thick, this means that the _____ (4) _____ changed suddenly. If we look at the rings on this tree, we can learn about the climate for a hundred years. We can see _____ (5) ______our climate is changing today. 我们都知道树木对我们日常生活是非常有用的。它们给予我们很多东西，例如木材、氧气、橡胶、药品和许多其他东西。它们还能告诉我们很多气候方面的东西。原因如下。如果你砍倒一棵树，你会看到它有很多圈。大多数树每过一年都会长一个新圈。因此，我们可以知道树的年龄。100多年的树意味着它有100多个圈。当气候非常干燥活非常寒冷时，树木生长较慢，而且年轮通常较细。当气候湿润温暖时，年轮会厚得多。如果年轮突然非常细或突然非常厚，这说明气候变化很突然。如果我们看看这棵树的年轮，我们会了解100年的气候状况。而且我们会看到气候是如何变更的。
