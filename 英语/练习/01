二、阅读理解



The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people’s lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14, 1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792, to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie, also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation. The Revolution went through a period of terror. Thousands of people lost their lives. In the end, power passed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

法国大革命于1789年爆发。当时法国正处于危机之中。政府管理不善，人民生活悲惨。路易十四国王试图控制议会，提高税收。但他的努力失败了。他命令他的部队去凡尔赛。人们认为路易斯打算用武力镇压革命。1789年7月14日，他们攻占了巴士底狱，那里关押着政治犯。从那天起，7月14日就是法国国庆日。路易试图在1792年逃离这个国家，以获得奥地利和普鲁士的支持。然而，他却被抓入狱。1792年9月，君主制被废除。同年，路易斯被处决。几个月后，他的妻子玛丽也被砍头了。法国革命吓坏了欧洲其他国王。奥地利和普鲁士的军队开始向法国进军。法国人召集共和军保卫国家。革命经历了一段恐怖时期。成千上万的人丧生。最后，权力移交给了拿破仑·波拿巴。

Once James Thornhill, a famous English painter, was asked to paint some pictures on the walls of the king's palace in England.

Then workers were sent for and a big platform（台子）was made.

With the help of a worker, Thornhill started painting on the platform. They worked for a whole year and at last the pictures were ready.

Thornhill was happy when he looked at the pictures, for they were really beautiful. He looked at them for a long time, and then took one step back and looked again. Now the pictures were even more beautiful. He took another step, then another. Finally he was at the very edge of the platform, but he didn't know it because he was thinking of his pictures.

The worker saw everything. "What should I do?" he thought. "Thornhill was at the very edge of the platform. If I cry out, he will take another step, fall off it and surely be killed. "So the worker quickly took some paint（漆）and threw it at the pictures.

"What are you doing?" cried the painter, running quickly forward to his pictures.

桑希尔看到这些照片时很高兴，因为它们真的很漂亮。他看了他们很长时间，然后退了一步再看。现在照片更漂亮了。他又走了一步，然后又走了一步。最后他来到了讲台的边缘，但他不知道，因为他在想他的照片。

工人看到了一切。”我该怎么办？”他想。”桑希尔就在月台的边缘。我若呼喊，他必再走一步，从那里掉下来，必定被杀。”于是，工人很快地拿了一些油漆（上漆）扔到了照片上。
