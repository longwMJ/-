二、阅读理解



The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people’s lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14, 1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792, to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie, also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation. The Revolution went through a period of terror. Thousands of people lost their lives. In the end, power passed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

What makes a person a scientist? Does he have ways or tools of learning that are different from those of others? The answer is “no”. It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that makes him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answers he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works.

The scientist’s knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the Theory of Relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of his mathematics was later tested through investigations, and Einstein’s ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations. 

什么使一个人成为科学家？他有没有不同于其他人的学习方法或工具？答案是“不”。不是科学家使用的工具，而是他如何使用这些工具，才使他成为科学家。你可能会同意知道如何使用电源对木匠很重要。你可能也会同意，知道如何调查、如何发现信息对每个人都很重要。然而，科学家更进一步，他必须确保他对自己的问题有一个合理的答案，并且他的答案可以被其他人确认。他还致力于将他对许多问题的答案融入到一系列关于世界如何运作的想法中。

这位科学家的知识一定是准确的。一半是对的，一半是对的，一半是对的。他必须在条件允许的情况下尽可能正确。一次在一组条件下工作的内容在其他时间必须在相同条件下工作。如果条件不同，科学家在演示中观察到的任何变化都必须用条件的变化来解释。这就是调查在科学中很重要的一个原因。爱因斯坦发展了相对论，他是通过数学得出这个理论的。后来通过调查检验了爱因斯坦数学的准确性，结果表明爱因斯坦的想法是正确的。科学家使用许多工具进行测量。然后，测量值被用来进行数学计算，以检验他的研究。
