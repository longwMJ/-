4、 Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn't want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68,his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son. But he was unhappy. He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired. Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again. He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%.He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly ,he hasn't been bored since he bought the factory.

摩根·里斯一直是个好商人。他以前有三个加油站，大部分时间都很忙。当他65岁，也就是正常的退休年龄时，他决定不想停止工作，于是他又继续工作了两年。最后，当他快68岁的时候，他的妻子多莉要求他退休，因为她想和他们一起享受晚年时光。他不情愿地把生意交给了儿子。但他不高兴。他不知道该怎么处理自己。尽管他读了很多书，和妻子一起去了有趣的地方度假，但他感到无聊，因为他讨厌退休而开始沮丧。后来有一天，他在报纸上看到一则广告，没有告诉妻子，他买了一家小陶器厂。下周他告诉了家人。他们既害怕又担心。他们认为71岁的他太大了，不能再工作了。他现在76岁了，已经大大扩大了公司的规模。他将员工数量从6人增加到24人，并为产品找到了许多新客户。他开发了出口市场，利润提高了200%，开了一家新的设计事务所，雇佣了三名年轻的设计师。他们到世界各地寻求新的想法，其中一人本周去了法国参加一个大型的贸易展览会。最重要的是，自从他买下这家工厂以来，他一直没有感到厌烦。摩根·里斯一直是个好商人。他以前有三个加油站，大部分时间都很忙。当他65岁，也就是正常的退休年龄时，他决定不想停止工作，于是他又继续工作了两年。最后，当他快68岁的时候，他的妻子多莉要求他退休，因为她想和他们一起享受晚年时光。他不情愿地把生意交给了儿子。但他不高兴。他不知道该怎么处理自己。尽管他读了很多书，和妻子一起去了有趣的地方度假，但他感到无聊，因为他讨厌退休而开始沮丧。后来有一天，他在报纸上看到一则广告，没有告诉妻子，他买了一家小陶器厂。下周他告诉了家人。他们既害怕又担心。他们认为71岁的他太大了，不能再工作了。他现在76岁了，已经大大扩大了公司的规模。他将员工数量从6人增加到24人，并为产品找到了许多新客户。他开发了出口市场，利润提高了200%，开了一家新的设计事务所，雇佣了三名年轻的设计师。他们到世界各地寻求新的想法，其中一人本周去了法国参加一个大型的贸易展览会。最重要的是，自从他买下这家工厂以来，他一直没有感到厌烦。

7、 The residents of 24 Acacia Grove were dissatisfied with the condition of the property, so John Preston called a meeting to discuss things last week. At the meeting John suggested setting up a residents' committee. Everyone was so worried and angry about the agent's inactivity that they agreed, and they elected John as chairman of the committee. Many residents said that they were tired of telephoning the agent and tired of complaining about the flats. Although the agent was responsible for the flats, they thought that he didn't do enough. Therefore John was asked to write to the agent and say that they were disappointed with the management of the flats. The next service payment was due at the end of the month. However, they agreed not to pay it until they were happy with the plans to improve the property. They decided to tell the agent that he must start the work within one month. They all went away very pleased with themselves. The residents of 24 Acacia Grove were dissatisfied with the condition of the property, so John Preston called a meeting to discuss things last week.

24个金合欢林的居民对该地产的状况不满意，所以约翰·普雷斯顿上周召开了一次会议讨论此事。在会上，约翰建议成立一个居民委员会。每个人都为经纪人的不作为感到担忧和愤怒，他们同意了，并选举约翰为委员会主席。许多居民说，他们厌倦了给经纪人打电话，也厌倦了抱怨公寓。虽然经纪人对公寓负责，但他们认为他做得不够。因此，约翰被要求写信给代理人，说他们对公寓的管理感到失望。下一笔服务费应在月末支付。然而，他们同意在对改善房产的计划感到满意之前不支付。他们决定告诉代理人他必须在一个月内开始工作。他们都很高兴自己走了。24个金合欢林的居民对房子的状况不满意，所以约翰·普雷斯顿上周召开了一次会议讨论此事。在会上，约翰建议成立一个居民委员会。每个人都为经纪人的不作为感到担忧和愤怒，他们同意了，并选举约翰为委员会主席。许多居民说，他们厌倦了给经纪人打电话，也厌倦了抱怨公寓。虽然经纪人对公寓负责，但他们认为他做得不够。因此，约翰被要求写信给代理人，说他们对公寓的管理感到失望。下一笔服务费应在月末支付。然而，他们同意在对改善房产的计划感到满意之前不支付。他们决定告诉代理人他必须在一个月内开始工作。他们都很高兴自己走了。

8、 What makes a person a scientist? Does he have ways or tools of learning that are different from those of others? The answer is “no”. It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that make him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answer he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works. The scientist's knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of this mathematics was later tested through investigations, Einstein's ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations.

8.什么使一个人成为科学家？他有没有不同于其他人的学习方法或工具？答案是“不”。不是科学家使用的工具，而是他如何使用这些工具使他成为科学家。你可能会同意知道如何使用电源对木匠很重要。你可能也会同意，知道如何调查、如何发现信息对每个人都很重要。然而，科学家更进一步，他必须确保他对自己的问题有一个合理的答案，并且他的答案可以被其他人确认。他还努力使自己对许多问题的答案与一系列关于世界如何运作的想法相适应。这位科学家的知识一定是准确的。一半是对的，一半是对的，一半是对的。他必须在条件允许的情况下尽可能正确。一次在一组条件下工作的内容在其他时间必须在相同条件下工作。如果条件不同，科学家在演示中观察到的任何变化都必须用条件的变化来解释。这就是调查在科学中很重要的一个原因。爱因斯坦发展了相对论，他是通过数学得出这个理论的。后来通过调查检验了这一数学的准确性，爱因斯坦的想法被证明是正确的。科学家使用许多工具进行测量。然后，测量值被用来进行数学计算，以检验他的研究。

9、 When I was a little girl, my brother and I collected stamps for many years. My mother didn't use to work during the week, but she worked in the post office near our house on Saturdays, and she used to bring home all the new stamps as soon as they were issued(发行）. On the day of the world cup football final in London in 1966, we were very excited because England were playing West Germany in the final. When we were having lunch, my mother told us to go to the post office straightaway after the match if England won, but she didn't tell us why. At 2o'clock my mother went back to work as usual, while the rest of the family were watching the football on TV at home. Although she wasn't watching the match, she was listening to it on the radio. England won 4:2 and so my brothers and I ran to the post office. As we burst in, my mother was standing behind the counter. She was waiting to sell us a very special limited edition with ENGLAND WINNERS on each stamp. We were over the moon. We still have it today, and perhaps it is worth a lot of money.

10、 The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbors are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country , it is not the largest in the world. In 2000, its population was over 222 million. When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are “the only real Americans”. Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who came first in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern of North America were mostly from England. It is for the reason that the language of the United States is English and that its culture and customs are more like those of England than those of any other country in the world.
美国覆盖了北美大陆的大部分。它的邻居是北部的加拿大和南部的墨西哥。虽然美国是一个大国，但它并不是世界上最大的国家。2000年，人口超过2.22亿。当这片土地第一次成为一个国家时，在从英国独立后，它有十三个州。每一个州都由一颗星星代表在美国国旗上。所有这些都在大陆的东部。随着国家向西发展，新的州被增加，新的星星出现在国旗上。很长一段时间里，有48颗星星。然而，在1959年，又有两颗星星被添加到国旗上，代表了新的阿拉斯加州和夏威夷。印第安人是这片土地上的第一批人，现在是美国。现在仍有成千上万的印度人生活在这个国家的各个地方。有时据说印第安人是“唯一真正的美国人”。大多数美国人来自世界各地。在北美洲东部，那些在大多数人中居首位的人大多来自英国。这是因为美国的语言是英语，它的文化和习俗比世界上任何其他国家的文化和习俗更像英国。

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1、 In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S.no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.
在美国，习惯上早上很早打电话给某人。如果你一大早给他打电话，当他刮胡子或吃早饭时，打电话的时间表明这件事非常重要，需要立即关注。晚上11点以后打的电话也有同样的含义。如果有人在睡觉时间接到电话，他会认为这是生死攸关的问题。为呼叫选择的时间表示其重要性。在社会生活中，时间起着非常重要的作用。在美国，如果宴会日期前三到四天邀请客人参加晚宴，客人往往会觉得自己不受重视。但并非所有国家都如此。在世界上的其他地区，提前预约可能被认为是愚蠢的，因为一周多的约会计划往往会被遗忘。时间的意义在世界不同的地方是不同的。因此，不同文化的人对时间的看法不同，他们之间产生了误解。例如，在美国生活中，及时性被高度重视。如果人们不及时，他们可能会被视为不礼貌或不负全部责任。在美国，没有人会考虑让一个商业伙伴等一个小时，这太不礼貌了。迟到5分钟的人会说几句解释的话，尽管他可能不会完成句子。

2、 How men first learnt to invent words is unknown; in other words, the origin of language is a mystery. All we really know is that men, unlike animals, somehow invented certain sounds to express thought and feelings, actions and things, so that they could communicate with each other; and that later they agreed upon certain signs, called letters, which could be combined to present those sounds, and which could be written down. Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words. The power of words, then, lies in their associations-the thing they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases. Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears. We should therefore learn to choose our words carefully and use them accurately, or they will make our speech silly and vulgar.
人类是如何第一次学会创造词汇的还不得而知；换句话说，语言的起源是个谜。我们真正知道的是，人类不同于动物，不知何故发明了某些声音来表达思想、感情、行动和事物，以便他们能够相互交流；后来，他们同意了某些符号，称为字母，可以组合起来表达这些声音，以及我可以写下来。这些声音，无论是口头的还是书面的，我们都称之为单词。那么，语言的力量就在于它们的联想，即它们在我们头脑中提出的东西。语言通过经验变得对我们充满意义；我们活得越久，某些词语就越能让我们想起我们过去的快乐和悲伤；我们读得越多，学到的越多，意味着某种事物的词语就越多。伟大的作家不仅有伟大的思想，而且用语言表达这些思想，这些思想对我们的思想和情感有着强烈的吸引力。这种用词的迷人和生动是我们所说的文学风格。最重要的是，真正的诗人是文字大师。他可以用像音乐一样歌唱的语言来表达他的意思，通过他们的地位和联系可以让人感动到流泪。因此，我们应该学会谨慎地选择词语，准确地使用它们，否则我们的言语会变得愚蠢和低俗。

3、 When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay, they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed, tables, dishes, and so on) has become one of America's fastest growing businesses. What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couple-people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture that they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy. One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don't like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think.(248words)
当约翰和维多利亚福尔斯抵达纽约一年后，他们没有带很多东西。他们原计划要么住在有家具的公寓里，要么买二手家具。但是他们很快就了解到一个越来越多的人正在使用的新系统。出租家俱（床、桌、菜等）已成为美国发展最快的行业之一。什么样的人租他们的家俱而不是买它们？国际商务或政府官员、外国学生、航空公司员工、年轻已婚夫妇，他们的工作或业务可能迫使他们经常从一个城市搬到另一个城市。他们每次都省去很多麻烦和搬运家具的费用。他们到了新家就租新家具。没有钱的年轻人不想买他们可能很快就不喜欢的便宜家具。他们宁愿等到有足够的钱买他们真正喜欢的家具。同时，他们发现他们可以租到比买得起的质量更好的家具。一个家庭，现在有了自己的大而漂亮的房子，非常喜欢他们租来的家具，所以他们决定继续租，而不是买新的东西。但通常人们不喜欢把这件事告诉别人。租用家居用品的想法还是很新的，他们不确定邻居们会怎么想。（248字）

4、 There are three kinds of goals: short-term, medium-range and long term goals. Short-term goals are those that usually deal with current activities, which we can apply on a daily basis. Such goals can be achieved in a week or less, or two weeks, or possibly, months. It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation, long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short- term goals. Upon completing our short-term goals, we should date the occasion and then add new short-term goals that will build on those that have been completed. The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals. They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school year, or they could even extend for several years. Any time you move a step at a time, you should never allow yourself to become discouraged or overwhelmed. As you complete each step, you will enforce the belief in your ability to grow and succeed. And as your list of completion dates grow, your motivation and desire will increase. Long-term goals may be related to our dreams of the future. They might cover five years or more. Life is not a static thing. We should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action.
目标有三种：短期目标、中期目标和长期目标。短期目标是那些通常处理当前活动的目标，我们可以每天应用这些目标。这样的目标可以在一周或更短的时间内实现，也可以在两周或可能的几个月内实现。应该记住的是，正如一座建筑并不比它的基础更坚固，长期目标在实现短期目标的同时，也不会有太大的作用。完成短期目标后，我们应该确定日期，然后添加新的短期目标，这些目标将建立在已经完成的目标之上。中间目标是建立在短期目标的基础上的。他们可能只处理一个学期或整个学年，甚至可以延长几年。任何时候你一步一步地走，你都不应该让自己变得气馁或不知所措。当你完成每一步的时候，你将加强对自己成长和成功能力的信念。随着完成日期的增加，你的动机和愿望也会增加。长期目标可能与我们对未来的梦想有关。它们可能覆盖五年或更长时间。生活不是静止的。我们不应该允许一个长期目标限制我们或我们的行动方针。
