4、 Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn't want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68,his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son. But he was unhappy. He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired. Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again. He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%.He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly ,he hasn't been bored since he bought the factory.

摩根·里斯一直是个好商人。他以前有三个加油站，大部分时间都很忙。当他65岁，也就是正常的退休年龄时，他决定不想停止工作，于是他又继续工作了两年。最后，当他快68岁的时候，他的妻子多莉要求他退休，因为她想和他们一起享受晚年时光。他不情愿地把生意交给了儿子。但他不高兴。他不知道该怎么处理自己。尽管他读了很多书，和妻子一起去了有趣的地方度假，但他感到无聊，因为他讨厌退休而开始沮丧。后来有一天，他在报纸上看到一则广告，没有告诉妻子，他买了一家小陶器厂。下周他告诉了家人。他们既害怕又担心。他们认为71岁的他太大了，不能再工作了。他现在76岁了，已经大大扩大了公司的规模。他将员工数量从6人增加到24人，并为产品找到了许多新客户。他开发了出口市场，利润提高了200%，开了一家新的设计事务所，雇佣了三名年轻的设计师。他们到世界各地寻求新的想法，其中一人本周去了法国参加一个大型的贸易展览会。最重要的是，自从他买下这家工厂以来，他一直没有感到厌烦。摩根·里斯一直是个好商人。他以前有三个加油站，大部分时间都很忙。当他65岁，也就是正常的退休年龄时，他决定不想停止工作，于是他又继续工作了两年。最后，当他快68岁的时候，他的妻子多莉要求他退休，因为她想和他们一起享受晚年时光。他不情愿地把生意交给了儿子。但他不高兴。他不知道该怎么处理自己。尽管他读了很多书，和妻子一起去了有趣的地方度假，但他感到无聊，因为他讨厌退休而开始沮丧。后来有一天，他在报纸上看到一则广告，没有告诉妻子，他买了一家小陶器厂。下周他告诉了家人。他们既害怕又担心。他们认为71岁的他太大了，不能再工作了。他现在76岁了，已经大大扩大了公司的规模。他将员工数量从6人增加到24人，并为产品找到了许多新客户。他开发了出口市场，利润提高了200%，开了一家新的设计事务所，雇佣了三名年轻的设计师。他们到世界各地寻求新的想法，其中一人本周去了法国参加一个大型的贸易展览会。最重要的是，自从他买下这家工厂以来，他一直没有感到厌烦。

8、 What makes a person a scientist? Does he have ways or tools of learning that are different from those of others? The answer is “no”. It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that make him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answer he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works. The scientist's knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of this mathematics was later tested through investigations, Einstein's ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations.

9、 When I was a little girl, my brother and I collected stamps for many years. My mother didn't use to work during the week, but she worked in the post office near our house on Saturdays, and she used to bring home all the new stamps as soon as they were issued(发行）. On the day of the world cup football final in London in 1966, we were very excited because England were playing West Germany in the final. When we were having lunch, my mother told us to go to the post office straightaway after the match if England won, but she didn't tell us why. At 2o'clock my mother went back to work as usual, while the rest of the family were watching the football on TV at home. Although she wasn't watching the match, she was listening to it on the radio. England won 4:2 and so my brothers and I ran to the post office. As we burst in, my mother was standing behind the counter.

10、 The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbors are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country , it is not the largest in the world. In 2000, its population was over 222 million. When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are “the only real Americans”. Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who came first in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern of North America were mostly from England. It is for the reason that the language of the United States is English and that its culture and customs are more like those of England than those of any other country in the world.
